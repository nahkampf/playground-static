							<h1>Playground Fanzine</h1>
							<p>Playground is a paper fanzine about larps. Read about larps that have been, larps that might be, and larps that never were. </p>
							<p>The fanzine is focused on participants sharing their experiences from larps they've participated in, but anything larp related can find its way onto our pages if it's interesting! </p>
							<p>All issues of Playground Fanzine are free to download in PDF format (see below). The hardcopies are printed in limited runs and are available upon request (contact us!).</p>
